To install the game, just open the terminal into the game directory "Nine-Morris-3D-vX.Y.Z-Linux"
and run the install.sh script with sudo. For now this script only works on Ubuntu version >= 20.4.

You can find a copy of this HELP_LINUX.txt file in /usr/local/share/ninemorris3d/ after install.

Make sure that you don't delete any of the files that come in that directory before installing. After
install you can safely delete the directory.

If you want to uninstall the game, run uninstall.sh with sudo. If you don't have the uninstall.sh
script anymore, don't worry, you can find a copy of it in /usr/local/share/ninemorris3d/. To delete the user
data that the game creates in you home directory, run the user_data_remove.sh script without sudo.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send them to simonmara.dev@gmail.com. I answer as
quickly as I can.

To install the game, just open the terminal into the game directory "Nine-Morris-3D-vX.Y.Z"
and run the install.sh script with sudo.

You can find a copy of this HELP.txt file in /usr/share/ninemorris3d after install.

Make sure that you don't delete any of the files that come in that directory.

If you want to uninstall the game, run uninstall.sh with sudo. If you don't have the uninstall.sh
script anymore, don't worry, you can find a copy of it in /usr/share/ninemorris3d.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send them to "simonmara.dev@gmail.com". I answer as
quickly as I can.
